# Makeup Market

This project is a mock makeup company, made with React and bundled with Vite, styled with TailwindCSS, Icons8 icons, and google fonts, and excitement.

With this project I got the chance to practice:

- styling with TailwindCSS

- problem solving to fix an error with Tailwind.

- customizing Tailwind Config file.

- creating a logo with CSS.

- learning on the spot (implementing a functional search bar!)

- responsive web design

- Problem solving using google and thinking of keywords to enter to google for a desired result

I learned:

- TO ACTUALLY GET THE FOOTER TO STICK TO THE BOTTOM USING MARGIN-TOP AUTO, AHH.

- To truncate numbers so that they only have two digits at the end. You use .toFixed(2) on it.

- To extract numbers from a string using "+" ex. (+"10") === 10

- Hero box shadow generated by cssgenerator.org

- Icons from icons8.com

- loading gif from loading.io

To upgrade later:

- add a full product page after clicking on a product

- add a way to show a certain amount of cards and have a button to render more to the screen

- filter shop by brands page

- organize shopbyprice

- add icons to shop by category cards

Notes:

- For some reason i needed to add `mode: jit' to my tailwind config to make my arbitrary value for a media query work. Not too sure what it does but I'm thankful that it worked ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
