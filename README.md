# Makeup Market

This project is a mock makeup company, made with React and bundled with Vite, styled with TailwindCSS, Icons8 icons, and google fonts, and excitement.

With this project I got the chance to practice:
- styling with TailwindCSS
- problem solving to fix an error with Tailwind.
- customizing Tailwind Config file.
- creating a logo with CSS.
- learning on the spot (implementing a functional search bar!)
- responsive design
