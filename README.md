# Makeup Market

This project is a mock makeup company, made with React and bundled with Vite, styled with TailwindCSS, and excitement. This was assigned to me to build by my technical bootcamp to practice interacting with API's, and I had a blast practing my coding, problem solving, and design skills.

With this project I got the chance to practice:

- styling with TailwindCSS

- problem solving to fix an error with Tailwind.

- customizing Tailwind Config file.

- creating a logo with CSS.

- learning on the spot (implementing a functional search bar!)

- responsive web design

- Problem solving using google and thinking of keywords to enter to google for a desired result

- Working on a different branch from main to preserve a previous version while I work on a new feature.
